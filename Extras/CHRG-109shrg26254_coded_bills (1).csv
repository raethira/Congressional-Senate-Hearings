330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Senator Murkowski,109,"murkowski, lisa",40300,CHRG-109shrg26254,1,,0,SENATE,"Good morning and welcome to the Energy Committee this morning.    The purpose of the hearing today is to receive testimony on S. 1829 pertaining to the Virgin Islands; S. 1830, to amend the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003; and S. 1831, which pertains to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.    Just very briefly this morning, I will describe the various legislation we have in front of us. S. 1829 would repeal sections of the U.S. Code to provide the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands the ability to fully regulate real property tax matters within the territory.    S. 1830 would make several changes to the Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003. Since the passage of this law, the administration has transmitted language to Congress that would provide authority for the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to obtain disaster assistance.    Then finally, S. 1831, to provide the CNMI with the same ownership and jurisdiction over offshore submerged lands as has been provided to other United States territories and to provide a less formal mechanism for the Governor of CNMI to raise issues with the Federal Government.    This morning we are honored to have with us the Honorable Donna Christensen, the Delegate to Congress from the U.S. Virgin Islands. Good morning and welcome to you. We also have the Lieutenant Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Honorable Vargrave Richards. Good morning and welcome. And we also have Nikolao Pula, who is the Director of the Office of Insular Affairs for the United States Department of the Interior, and welcome to you.    Additionally we have some written statements that have been submitted from the governments of the freely associated states of the RMI, the Republic of Palau, and the FSM. In addition, the Governor and the Resident Representative of the CNMI have submitted their written testimony.    Before we proceed with the hearing, I want to mention that we have received a request from the Resident Representative of the CNMI regarding legislation that is moving through the House of Representatives which would provide the CNMI a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. The committee looks forward to working with the Resident Representative of the CNMI and the House of Representatives as this legislation proceeds.    I do welcome all of you this morning. I will just make a note. We are scheduled to have a vote coming up at 10:30. I anticipate that this will be a pretty expedited hearing, and we should probably make that vote without a problem, but just to alert you all to that.    With that, then let us begin with you, the Honorable Donna Christensen. Welcome.",10/25/05,R,5,0,
330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Mrs. Christensen,109,NA,NA,CHRG-109shrg26254,NA,,NA,SENATE,"Thank you, Madam Chairman, and good morning. I want to thank you for the opportunity to make this statement in support of S. 1829, companion legislation to one I introduced in the House, to repeal the 1936 law which governs the levying of property taxes in the Virgin Islands. Passage of this legislation is necessary to allow the Virgin Islands to fashion a local property tax law that takes into account the circumstances and realities of our community.    I also want to especially thank Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman for their willingness to respond to my request to introduce S. 1829 and to you, Madam Chair, for working with them to so quickly schedule it for a hearing.    Madam Chairman and members, this bill became necessary when 5 years ago some of my constituents filed a lawsuit in Federal court alleging that the Virgin Islands government was violating Federal law in the manner in which they were assessing the value of commercial properties in the territory. The court then ruled that the 1936 Federal statute was not repealed by the 1954 Organic Act, as we had all believed, and thus invalidated the current Virgin Islands property tax law.    Madam Chair, the Virgin Islands is the only jurisdiction in the country whose local property taxes are based on Federal law. This anomaly in our system of government is unnecessary today because the Virgin Islands, although still a territory of the United States, has been exercising all the rights and responsibilities of government in a similar manner as the 50 States, at least since Congress passed our revised organic act in 1954 and we, of course, began electing our own Governors in 1970.    In invalidating our local property tax laws, the Federal courts have removed the ability of the Virgin Islands government to provide insulation for Virgin Islands homeowners to protect them against the consequences of rapidly rising property values on their tax bills.    Moreover, the provisions that were struck down were similar to those used in other jurisdictions throughout this country. The local property tax laws, which were struck down, provided a 10 percent cap on the increase in assessments for residential real estate in any assessment period, as well as certain exemptions from taxation for homesteads, veterans, and farmland, and exemptions offered as part of our economic incentive program.    Madam Chair, the 10 percent cap limiting any increase in residential assessments is modeled after similar statutes in the United States and is essential to protect homeowners from soaring property values. Without a cap or similar provisions, if an individual or family owns a modest dwelling that is surrounded by million dollar homes, the assessed value and thus the property taxes will increase significantly.    This will have serious consequences for long-time property holders. We have limited land mass in the Virgin Islands which makes real property a commodity that is in short supply.    Because the current trend in real estate is for prices to continue to climb exponentially, basing property taxes on actual prices will create a large number of instant paper millionaires who will never be able to see this new wealth unless the property is mortgaged or sold.    This situation presents a very serious one for many of my constituents, most acutely on the island of St. John because their property tax bills are already moving way beyond their reach.    Many of the areas on St. John have seen wealthy individuals purchasing properties and making improvements which have had the effect of immediately and drastically increasing the value of their properties, as well as the value of the properties surrounding them.    I must caution, however, that the entire Virgin Islands would be impacted should the 1936 law continue to prevail.    In summary, it is important for the economic security, as well as the social stability, of the territory for the 1936 statute to be repealed.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to submit the testimony for the record of Senator Craig Barshinger; former Senator Almando Liburd; Mr. Myron Allick, a local businessman; and Ms. Sharon Coldren, president of the Coral Bay Community Council.    I want to thank you once again for bringing this important bill to the committee in such an expeditious fashion. I look forward to the speedy passage and to returning to testify on an equally important piece of legislation which has already passed the House twice, one which would create a chief financial office for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Thank you, Madam Chair.",10/25/05,NA,NA,NA,

330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Mr. Richards,109,NA,NA,CHRG-109shrg26254,NA,,NA,SENATE,"Good morning, Madam Chair and distinguished members of the committee. At this time, I would like to recognize my distinguished Delegate to Congress who introduced this legislation, which is critical to the people of the Virgin Islands.    My name is Vargrave Richards, and I am the Lieutenant Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. On behalf of Governor Turnbull and the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands, I am here before you to testify in support of S. 1829.    Under Virgin Islands law, the Office of the Tax Assessor falls under the Office of the Lieutenant Governor. The tax assessor is charged with generating the real property tax bills for the Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands.    I am here to respectfully request that you adopt S. 1829, which repeals sections 1401 through 1401(e) of title 48 of the U.S. Code, which limit the authority of the Virgin Islands to assess and collect real property taxes in the territory.    I strongly support the bill for three reasons.    One, a recent court ruling held that the 1936 statute prohibits the territory from setting its own real property tax policy.    Two, the 69-year-old statute, which was designed to assist the Virgin Islands, now hinders it from performing a basic governmental function and has a debilitating effect.    And three, this is a purely local issue with no Federal impact.    The reason I am here before you is a recent court ruling which has essentially revived a long forgotten Federal statute governing the assessment of real property taxes in the territory.    On June 28, 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued an opinion affirming a decision of the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands in Berne Corp. v. Government of the Virgin Islands. The court held that the 1936 Statute is still controlling in the Virgin Islands and that it governs the basis for assessment for real property taxes in the territory, preempting subsequent local laws in this area. Based on the 1936 Statute, the court ordered that all property subject to taxation be taxed on the basis of actual value and at the same rate. Under the ruling, to be valid, an exemption must grant a 100 percent exemption from taxation, cover the full tax year of the exemption period, and apply to all subject property.    The effect of the ruling is far-reaching. It limits the Virgin Islands in the performance of the basic government function of setting real property tax policy.    In order to protect homeowners in the territory from losing their land due to the inability to pay property tax increases resulting from a dramatic rise in property values due to the outside investment, local law provides that no residential tax bills can increase more than 10 percent over the previous valuation. This crucial provision, however, was struck down by the courts as inconsistent with the 1936 Statute.    The problem of rising land values is particularly acute on the island of St. John, two-thirds of which is national park. Recent development has generated increased property values and, therefore, higher property taxes. Many Virgin Islanders fear losing land which has been in their family for generations because of the inability to pay increased property taxes. Indeed, at a recent town meeting on St. John, I heard firsthand from residents who passionately expressed their concern that the recent court decision would lead to soaring taxes and force them out of their respective homes. Since the days of emancipation, in our islands land has been a precious commodity which has traditionally passed from generation to generation.    Unless S. 1829 is adopted, the Virgin Islands will not have the ability to reinstitute the 10 percent cap or to employ other appropriate tax policy measures to address the legitimate concerns of these Virgin Islanders desirous of preserving their land for their children.    Based on the ruling, the 1936 Statute may also preclude our local government from establishing partial tax exemptions for veterans, the elderly, or farmers, and from using tax policy to encourage development through the creation of the Enterprise Zones. While State and local governments are free to set different tax rates for different uses of property, such as residential, agricultural, commercial, income-producing, or charitable, the 1936 law prevents our local government from doing the same. To my knowledge, no State, no county, city, or territory has such restrictive provisions imposed upon it by the Congress.    In short, the 1936 Statute needs to be repealed in order to put us on par with other jurisdictions, such as Montgomery County or New York City, and to enable us to set our own local tax policy.    The second reason. The 1936 Statute was adopted by Congress to reform the real property tax system in the Virgin Islands, which at the time was based upon the use to which property was put as opposed to its value. Cultivated or developed land was taxed at a higher rate. It was felt that this system was unfair to those who cultivated their land and the policy discouraged cultivation and also favored a few large owners.    A third reason. The adoption of S. 1829 and the consequent repeal of the 1936 Statute will have absolutely no economic effect on the Federal Government. Like State and local property taxes, Virgin Islands real property taxes are imposed by the territory and are payable to the territory. This is a local matter. It is not a Federal question.    In 1936, the Virgin Islands were closely administered by the Federal Government. Since then there has been a steady progression toward local autonomy in an effort to move from colonialism toward self-governance. In 1954, Congress passed the Revised Organic Act which established a framework for Virgin Islands self-government, and in 1968, Congress passed the Elective Governor Act which authorized the popular election of the Virgin Islands Governor and eliminated the power of the President to veto local legislation.    The provisions of the 1936 Statute that might have been viewed as necessary by Washington in the colonial era now bind the hands of the Virgin Islands government and prevent it from enacting socially and economically beneficial legislation. While it is the Government's position that the 1936 Statute was implicitly repealed by the Revised Organic Act of 1954, the court ruling provided otherwise, making an express congressional repeal necessary to achieve the goal of self-government for the territory.    I would like to thank the Honorable Congresswoman Donna Christensen for sponsoring this legislation.    Senator, I respectfully request you adopt S. 1829 and repeal the old and outdated 1936 Federal Statute. I thank you for your time and attention to a matter of great importance to the people of the Virgin Islands.    Madam Chair, your father, I understand, has been very influential in the territory for many, many years. So we want to convey our thanks and gratitude.",10/25/05,NA,NA,NA,

330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Mr. Pula,109,NA,NA,CHRG-109shrg26254,NA,,NA,SENATE,"Thank you.    S. 1829 would repeal sections 1 through 6 of the 1936 Organic Act of the Virgin Islands, which deal with property taxation. In 2004, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that these provisions were still in effect. This decision invalidated local Virgin Islands statutes that give exemptions to residents such as veterans and seniors.    For decades, the Department of the Interior has sponsored and backed measures that increase self-government for the territories. S. 1829 would return control of the property tax to the government of the Virgin Islands and property taxes would be levied as they were prior to the Third Circuit's decision. The administration supports the enactment of S. 1829.    S. 1831 deals with two subjects: submerged lands and the settlement of claims pursuant to the CNMI Covenant. Do you want to wait on this, or do you want me to continue?",10/25/05,NA,NA,0,1
330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Senator Murkowski,109,"murkowski, lisa",40300,CHRG-109shrg26254,1,,0,SENATE,Go ahead. The vote has not yet started.,10/25/05,R,5,0,
330,SENATE-Energy and Natural Resources,SENATE,Mr. Pula,109,NA,NA,CHRG-109shrg26254,NA,,NA,SENATE,"All right.    Section 1 of S. 1831 would give the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands authority over its submerged lands.    It has been the position of the Federal Government that United States submerged lands around the Northern Mariana Islands did not transfer to the CNMI. This position was validated in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. One consequence of this decision is that CNMI law enforcement personnel lacked jurisdiction in the territorial waters surrounding the islands of CNMI without a grant from the Federal Government.    Currently the CNMI is the only U.S. territory that does not have title to the submerged lands. It is appropriate that CNMI be given the same authority as her sister territories.    The administration, therefore, supports enactment of section 1 of S. 1831, provided that language is added regarding consistent interpretation.    Section 2 of S. 1831 would permit the Secretary of the Interior to settle claims of the CNMI arising pursuant to the CNMI Covenant. The authority would be activated by a request by the Governor of the CNMI.    The administration does not support the enactment of section 2 of S. 1831 because it does not believe that the creation of an additional formal mechanism with its attendant costs, as described in the bill, is necessary.    Although we were not specifically invited to speak with regard to the compact-related amendments in S. 1830, with your indulgence I would like to raise one issue that is not considered in the bill.    The Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 contemplated the creation of separate trust funds for the peoples of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. To aid in building corpus, both compacts provide that their respective trust funds shall not be subject to Federal or State taxes.    Another provision requires that the trust funds be incorporated in the District of Columbia. Because the District of Columbia is neither a State nor the Federal Government, the intended tax-free status of the trust fund has been called into question.    The administration, therefore, requests that the following new section be added to S. 1830, an amendment for the tax-free status in the District. ``Clarification of Tax-Free Status of Trust Funds. In the U.S.-RMI Compact, the U.S.-FSM Compact, and their respective trust funds subsidiary agreements, for the purposes of taxation by the United States or its subsidiary jurisdictions, the word `state' means `state, territory, or the District of Columbia.' ''    Such an amendment would ensure that full effect will be given to the intended tax-free status of the trust funds.    I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify today.",10/25/05,NA,NA,0,1
